Topics :

Recursion 
-> what is recursion
-> how to think recursively
some basic problems :
1. print 1 to n
2. print n to 1 
3. print an array using recursion


2D array 
-> what is 2D array
-> why do we need it 
-> how to declare and use it
-> how 2D array is similar to matrix 
-> square  matrix 
-> primary and secondary diagonal 
-> unit matrix definition  -> checking 

Practice Problem 
1.T. Matrix https://codeforces.com/group/MWSDmqGsZm/contest/219774/problem/T 
-> to know better about primary and secondary diagonal
2. Search in the matrix (https://codeforces.com/group/MWSDmqGsZm/contest/219774/problem/S)
-> to know better about searching for an element in 2d array 
3. Summation (https://codeforces.com/group/MWSDmqGsZm/contest/223339/problem/L)
-> to know better about how recursion works in an array + how to think 
4. Lucky Array (https://codeforces.com/group/MWSDmqGsZm/contest/219774/problem/J)
-> Implementation
5. Choose elements (https://codeforces.com/group/MWSDmqGsZm/contest/329103/problem/C)
-> sorting and some key points : atmost , exactly
